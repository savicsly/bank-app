# Banking Application Development Assignment

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive **Java Banking Application** that incorporates a full-featured GUI using **AWT and Swing components**. The application should perform all core banking operations while maintaining **persistent data storage using text files**.

## Requirements

### 1. GUI Implementation

Create a user-friendly interface with the following components:

- Login screen with authentication
- Main dashboard displaying account summary
- Transaction screens (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)
- Account management section
- Reports and statements view

Use both **AWT** and **Swing** components appropriately, demonstrating your understanding of:

- Layout managers (`BorderLayout`, `GridLayout`, `FlowLayout`, etc.)
- Event handling (`ActionListener`, `MouseListener`, etc.)
- Custom components and containers
- Menu systems and dialog boxes
- `JTable`s for data presentation

### 2. Banking Functionality

Implement the following banking features:

- Customer account creation and management
- Multiple account types (Savings, Current)
- Interest calculation based on account type
- Transaction processing with proper validation
- Balance inquiry and statement generation
- Scheduled payments and transfers
- Loan application and management

### 3. File I/O Operations

Implement robust file handling for persistent data storage:

- Store customer details, account information, and transaction history in text files
- Implement proper read/write operations with error handling
- Create a file structure that allows efficient data retrieval
- Ensure data integrity through validation and backup mechanisms
- Implement search functionality to query records

### 4. Advanced Features

Incorporate at least **five** of the following advanced Java features:

- Multi-threading for concurrent operations
- Custom exception handling for banking-specific errors
- Java Collections Framework for data management
- Regular expressions for input validation
- Java Date and Time API for transaction timestamps and scheduling

### 5. Security

Implement basic security measures:

- Password encryption for user authentication
- Transaction authorization workflows
- Session management and timeout features
- Input validation to prevent common attacks
- Audit logging of critical operations

## Deliverables

- Complete source code with appropriate documentation
- User manual explaining the application features
- Technical documentation outlining:
  - Class structure and relationships
  - File format specifications
  - GUI component hierarchy
  - Exception handling approach
  - Threading model (if implemented)

## Evaluation Criteria

Your application will be evaluated based on:

- Completeness of banking functionality
- Group presentation and individual contributions
- Quality and usability of the GUI implementation
- Effective use of both AWT and Swing components
- Robustness of file I/O operations
- Implementation of advanced Java features
- Code quality, organization, and documentation
- Error handling and overall application stability

## Bonus Points

- Implementing a database connection option alongside text file storage
- Creating a visually appealing UI with custom graphics
- Adding reporting features with charts and graphs
- Implementing a notification system for account activities
