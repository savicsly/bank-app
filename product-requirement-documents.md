| **Requirement ID** | **Description**                                                    | **User Story**                                                                                     | **Expected Behavior/Outcome**                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GUI-01**         | Login screen with authentication                                   | As a user, I want to securely log in with my credentials so that I can access my account.          | User enters valid credentials → Access granted. Invalid credentials → Error dialog displayed. |
| **GUI-02**         | Dashboard with account summary                                     | As a user, I want to view my account balance and recent transactions at a glance.                  | Dashboard displays real-time balance, transaction history in a `JTable`.                      |
| **GUI-03**         | Transaction screens (deposit/withdrawal/transfer)                  | As a user, I want to perform transactions easily so I can manage my funds.                         | Forms validate inputs (e.g., amount > 0) → Success message and updated balance displayed.     |
| **GUI-04**         | Account management (create/edit accounts)                          | As a user, I want to create or edit accounts (Savings/Current) to organize my finances.            | New accounts saved to `accounts.txt`; edits reflected immediately in the dashboard.           |
| **GUI-05**         | Reports and statements view                                        | As a user, I want to generate statements to track my financial activity.                           | Statements display transactions filtered by date and exported as text files.                  |
| **SAV-01**         | Multiple account types (Savings/Current)                           | As a user, I want a Savings account to earn interest and a Current account for daily transactions. | Savings accounts auto-calculate daily interest (2.5%); Current accounts have no interest.     |
| **SAV-02**         | Transaction validation (e.g., overdraft prevention)                | As a user, I want transactions blocked if I lack sufficient funds to avoid fees.                   | Withdrawal/transfer attempts exceeding balance → Error: "Insufficient funds."                 |
| **SAV-03**         | Loan application and management                                    | As a user, I want to apply for a loan and track its repayment schedule.                            | Loan terms calculated and saved; repayment reminders displayed in the dashboard.              |
| **FILE-01**        | Persistent storage of customer/account data in text files          | As a user, I want my data saved securely so I don’t lose it between sessions.                      | All data (accounts, transactions) retained in `accounts.txt`, `transactions.txt`, etc.        |
| **FILE-02**        | Backup mechanism for data integrity                                | As a user, I want backups created automatically to recover from system failures.                   | Daily backups stored in `/backups`; restore option available via admin menu.                  |
| **FILE-03**        | Search functionality for records                                   | As a user, I want to search transactions by date/amount to find specific activities.               | Search results populate a `JTable` with matching transactions.                                |
| **ADV-01**         | Multi-threading for background tasks (e.g., interest calculation)  | As a user, I want the app to run smoothly even during heavy computations.                          | Interest calculated nightly without freezing the UI.                                          |
| **ADV-02**         | Custom exceptions (e.g., `InvalidAccountException`)                | As a user, I want clear error messages when I make a mistake.                                      | Errors display user-friendly messages (e.g., "Invalid account number format").                |
| **ADV-03**         | Regex input validation (amounts, emails, account numbers)          | As a user, I want the app to prevent typos in critical fields.                                     | Invalid inputs (e.g., letters in amount field) → Red border highlights and error tooltip.     |
| **ADV-04**         | Java Date and Time API for transaction timestamps                  | As a user, I want accurate timestamps on transactions to track when they occurred.                 | All transactions include `LocalDateTime` in `transactions.txt`.                               |
| **ADV-05**         | Java Collections Framework for data management                     | As a user, I want fast access to my account details and transactions.                              | Account lookup via `HashMap`; transactions stored in `ArrayList` for quick retrieval.         |
| **SEC-01**         | Password encryption (SHA-256 with salt)                            | As a user, I want my password protected so unauthorized users can’t access my account.             | Passwords stored as hashes; plaintext never visible.                                          |
| **SEC-02**         | Session timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity                      | As a user, I want automatic logout for security if I forget to close the app.                      | Inactive sessions redirect to the login screen with a warning dialog.                         |
| **SEC-03**         | Audit logging of critical operations                               | As an admin, I want logs of user actions to investigate issues or fraud.                           | All logins, transactions, and errors recorded in `audit.log`.                                 |
| **SEC-04**         | Input validation to prevent SQL/script injection (future-proofing) | As a user, I want the app to block malicious inputs that could harm my data.                       | Suspicious inputs (e.g., `DROP TABLE`) rejected with an error.                                |
| **DEL-01**         | Source code with documentation (Javadoc)                           | As a developer, I want clear code structure and comments to maintain or extend the app.            | Code is modular, documented, and organized into packages (`gui`, `core`, `data`).             |
| **DEL-02**         | User manual explaining features                                    | As a user, I want a guide to learn how to use the app effectively.                                 | Manual includes screenshots and step-by-step instructions for all workflows.                  |
| **DEL-03**         | Technical documentation (class diagrams, file specs)               | As a developer, I want design specs to understand the architecture and data flow.                  | Documentation includes UML diagrams and file format details (e.g., `customers.txt` fields).   |

### **Notes**

- **Requirement ID Format**: Prefixes indicate categories (GUI = GUI, SAV = Savings, FILE = File I/O, ADV = Advanced, SEC = Security, DEL = Deliverables).
- **Validation**: Regex patterns (e.g., amount = `^\d+(\.\d{2})?$`) ensure data integrity.
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed with salt; audit logs track critical actions.
